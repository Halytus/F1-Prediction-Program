# F1-Prediction-Program

The goal of this project is to make a user input function that uses a simple regression model trained on lap times from the races data set to predict a likely lap time for the racer and track selected.

## Future Applications
 - I would like to add features and calculations to the function to include weather and temperature effects
 - Hosting the model on a server so that user input can call it via a custom API
 - Designing a simple website to handle user input with an embedded guide to help users pick racers and tracks
